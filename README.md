# BayesianForceInference
Bayesian force inference in epithelial tissue


## Description

This is a script for performing force inference in epithelial mechanics, proposed in [1] and [2].

Likelihood is accounted by force balance equations among cell junction tensions and cell pressures at vertices.
Prior is given by the expectation that tensions are positive. Then the tensions and pressures
are inferred by MAP estimation. Empirical Bayes method is adopted where hyper-parameters are determined to minimize
ABIC.

See [1] and [2] for details.

## Requirement

* PySPQR


## Usage

1. Prepare an input file in the same format as the attached sample (Sample/sample/).
2. Change the variable "filename" in Forceinf.py to the input file in step 1.
3. Run Forceinf.py on IDE or IPython.
